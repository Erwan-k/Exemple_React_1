Hello


The purpuse of this repository is teaching how to handle a list of items.

The docker-compose is meant to set 3 services up : 

- a database built from a mysql image

- an API self-made that operates on the database

- a react app that makes requests to the API


We display all the list items after calling the API to fetch the data.

We allow the user to add items with a modal.

We allow the user to delete an item with a Button.

We allow the user to edit the name attribute of a list element.


Enjoy,

Erwan
